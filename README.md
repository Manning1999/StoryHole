# StoryHole
I've always loved writing stories but have never really known where to begin so I decided to start developing this app to help people structure their writing.
What this program will eventually do is allow people to edit all the details for every aspect of story writing, from character design to locations, factions overall story, subplots, relationships etc. and give prompts for what sort of details make for a good story.

It uses a Microsoft Access database to store all the information. 

This is a project I work on intermitently and is by no means finished but I work on it now and then when I get the time.
